# SoCK Validator Library

SoCK Validator is a library developed with Python programming. This library contains functions that can be used in the process of validating the completeness of the knowledge graph data. The functions available in this library are data collection, shape formation, data validation, and data visualization. Users are expected to be familiar with using Python to use this library properly.

# Motivation

SoCK Validator is part of the SoCK Framework project. This project exists because it sees the rapid development of knowledge graphs, but it is not supported by good data quality, especially in terms of completeness. Therefore, the SoCK framework was developed as a pattern-oriented framework to support the creation and validation of knowledge about completeness in KGs.

# How to setup

- The user prepares a Python file.
- The user is looking for the required function.
- The user copies the function to be used and pastes it in the prepared file.
